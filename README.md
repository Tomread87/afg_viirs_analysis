# afg_viirs_analysis / Afghanistan VIIRS Data Analysis
Extract VIIRS and VIIRS-like data, pre-process them, and analyze their time-series NTL intensity while masking potential Afghan military bases.

All Jupyter notebooks are optimized for the Google Colab environment.
As of 2024 May 9, the latest VIIRS and VIIRS-like datasets have already been stored. So, at this moment, you don't need to update the raw datasets. Check the VIIRS downloader if you need the latest datasets.

## Quick start:
(1) Copy and paste all materials to your own Google Colab environment. If you are good at Python coding, a new Conda environment could also work but you likely need to modify some code blocks (especially around libraries and paths).

(2) Unless you need to update the raw VIIRS (VIIRS-like) data, you can start with VIIRS_analysis.ipynb. For detailed instructions, check the comments inside the notebooks.
